This project focuses on voice to text recognition. 
Provided was the list of 22 words(medical terms) and goal is to recognize 
these words in text.
I have added 3 three more words to expand the data slightly.Thus total 
data contains 25 words

Note: Due to insufficient amount of voice data the neural networks could not be
trained properly and checked for accuracy.
I have gathered and worked with 75 samples of 3 second audio clips in .WAV format \
sampled at the rate of 8000.

Folders
Speech2Text:
	1)data - raw audio clips
	2)train_data - this folder contains folders of 25 lables(medical words)
	  that need to be trained. 3 samples of each word have been stored in
	  in respective folders.
Jupyter Notebook: Feature extraction, data preprocessing and implementaion
of different models.
